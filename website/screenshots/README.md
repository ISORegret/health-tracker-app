# App screenshots for the website

Add PNG images here so they show in the "See PepTalk in action" section. Name them exactly:

| Filename          | Shown as   |
|------------------|------------|
| `summary.png`    | Summary    |
| `weight.png`     | Weight     |
| `injections.png` | Injections |
| `insights.png`   | Insights   |

**How to get screenshots**

1. Run the app on your Android phone or emulator.
2. Open each tab (Summary, Weight, Injections, Insights) and take a screenshot.
3. (Optional) Crop to just the app content; the site will scale them inside the phone frame.
4. Copy the images into this `screenshots` folder and use the names above.

**Suggested size:** about 390×844 px (or any 9:19.5-ish ratio) so they look good in the phone frame. Other sizes work too — the site scales them.

If a file is missing, that phone frame will show a dark placeholder until you add the image.
