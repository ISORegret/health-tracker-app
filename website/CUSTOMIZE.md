# Customize the website

After setup, replace these placeholders in **`index.html`**:

## 1. Buy me a coffee link

- **Current:** `https://buymeacoffee.com/peptalk`
- **Do this:** Sign up at [buymeacoffee.com](https://buymeacoffee.com), create your page, then in `index.html` search for **`buymeacoffee.com`** and replace with your real URL (e.g. `https://buymeacoffee.com/yourusername`).

## 2. Suggestions email (suggestion box)

- **Current:** `mailto:hello@example.com?subject=PepTalk%20suggestion%20%26%20feedback`
- **Do this:** In `index.html` search for **`hello@example.com`** and replace with the email where you want to receive suggestions and feedback.

---

**Summary:** Edit `index.html` → replace `buymeacoffee.com/peptalk` with your Buy Me a Coffee URL, and `hello@example.com` with your email. Then redeploy the site.
