## Summary: Gaps to Consider (from competitor sites)

**High impact (many competitors show these)**

1. **Apple Health / Google Fit sync** — Weight, steps, optional nutrition. Shotsy, Onederland, GLPer all highlight it.
2. **Side-effect logging** — Dedicated flow + calendar and per dose link. Shotsy/GLPer emphasize it.
3. **Export for doctors** — We have it (Constitute + JSON/CSV/PDF); keep highlighting it on the website.
4. **Social proof** — Testimonials, star count, download count. Add if you have numbers.

**Medium impact**

5. **Pen/vial lifecycle** — When received, out of fridge, expiry (GLPer).
6. **On track vs typical loss** — Simple comparison to clinical trial averages (Glapp-style).
7. **Fiber goal** — MeAgain has it; we have protein/water.
8. **AI meal / barcode** — Onederland, MeAgain; big build, optional.

**Already strong vs competitors**

- **Phase timelines + medication curves** — Same idea as Glapp bodyphases; we have more meds.
- **Constitute calculator + multi-format export** — JSON, CSV, PDF; many charge or don't offer.
- **No account, local-first** — Clear differentiator; competitors often require signup or cloud.
- **GLP-1 + peptides + TRT in one app** — Broader than Shotsy/GLPer/Onederland (GLP-1 focus).
