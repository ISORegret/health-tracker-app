# PepTalk vs. Popular Apps — Competitive Comparison

A snapshot of how PepTalk compares to the most relevant weight/medication/GLP-1 and peptide-tracking apps, plus what users ask for most.

---

## 1. Who’s in the same space?

| Category | Apps |
|----------|------|
| **GLP-1 / weight + shots** | Glapp, GLPer, Pep (GLP-1 Tracker), Noom (weight + coaching) |
| **Peptide / TRT injection** | OptiPin, PepTracker, TRT Tracker, Peptide Tracker (PeptideKit), Dose Track |
| **Weight / nutrition** | MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, Happy Scale, Nutrisense |

PepTalk overlaps with **Glapp**, **GLPer**, **PepTracker**, and **OptiPin** (injection + weight + some nutrition/calculators).

---

## 2. What users ask for most (from reviews & communities)

From Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, Bevel, and GLP-1/weight app feedback:

| Request | Why it matters |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Weight trend line / moving average** | Daily scale bounces are noisy; users want a “true trend” (e.g. Happy Scale–style). |
| **Individual data points on graphs** | See every weigh-in, not just averages. |
| **Integrations** | MyFitnessPal, Lose It, Cronometer, Apple Health, Google Fit — “one place for everything.” |
| **Export for doctor** | PDF or shareable summary (weight, meds, labs) for visits. |
| **Apple Health / Google Fit sync** | Auto-import weight, steps, etc.; single source of truth. |
| **Clearer graphs** | Less clutter, easier to read. |
| **Goal / milestone predictions** | “When will I hit my goal?” (Happy Scale–style). |

## 4. Summary: what they have that we don’t (by impact)

**High impact / frequently requested**

1. **Weight trend line / moving average** — “True” trend, not just raw points (Happy Scale–style).  
2. **Apple Health (and ideally Google Fit) sync** — Import weight/steps; export weight so others see it.  
3. **Peer or clinical trial comparison** — “Am I on track?” (Glapp’s differentiator).  
4. **Integrations** — MFP, Lose It, Cronometer (or at least CSV/API for power users).

**Medium impact**

5. **Auto progress reports** — Weekly/monthly summary without opening every tab.  
6. **Labs / blood work** — For TRT/peptide users (testosterone, estradiol, etc.).  
7. **Meal/recipe ideas** — Not full MFP, but “high protein / GLP-1 friendly” suggestions.  
8. **Cloud account + multi-device sync** — So data isn’t only on one phone.

**Nice to have**

9. **AI Q&A** (e.g. “When does semaglutide peak?”).  
10. **More export options** — CSV, or “share to doctor” flow (you already have PDF/print).  
11. **Milestones / mini-goals** for weight (e.g. every 5 lbs).  
12. **Food/calorie log** — Big product scope; integrations might satisfy demand first.

## 5. What PepTalk does better or differently

- **One app for GLP-1 + peptides + TRT** — Broader med list and phase timelines than Glapp/GLPer.  
- **Phase timelines + medication curves** — Same idea as Glapp “Bodyphases,” with more meds.  
- **Titration plan builder** — Built-in steps and timelines; many apps don’t have this.  
- **Reconstitution + dose + TDEE** — All in one place; GLPer has TDEE, others often don’t.  
- **No account required** — Local-first, good for privacy; cloud apps require signup.  
- **PDF/print for doctor** — You already have it; many competitors don’t or hide it behind paywall.  
- **Daily hydration + protein** — Simple and aligned with GLP-1/weight goals.

## 6. Suggested next steps (prioritized)

1. **Weight trend line** — Add a moving average or trend line on the weight chart (and optionally on Summary).  
2. **Apple Health read/write for weight** — Biggest “they have it, we don’t” ask; Google Fit next if you support Android.  
3. **“Am I on track?”** — Simple comparison to typical loss at current dose (e.g. “People on 1 mg semaglutide lose ~X lb/week on average”) using published data.  
4. **Milestones** — e.g. “5 lb down,” “10 lb down,” with optional celebration or badge.  
5. **CSV export** — For power users and for importing into MFP/Lose It/spreadsheets.  
6. **Optional cloud backup** — Account + encrypted sync so data isn’t device-only (could stay behind a flag).

Use this doc to decide what to build next and how to talk about PepTalk (“one app for GLP-1, peptides, and TRT”; “phase timelines + calculators + doctor PDF”; “no account, local-first”).
